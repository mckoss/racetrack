    <h1>Martin Gardner's Racetrack</h1>
    <p>
        This is computer simulation of Martin Gardner's <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetrack_(game)">Racetrack</a>
        game.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Racetrack is a paper and pencil game that simulates a car race, played
        by two or more players. The game is played on a squared sheet of paper,
        with a pencil line tracking each car's movement. The rules for moving
        represent a car with a certain inertia and physical limits on traction,
        and the resulting line is reminiscent of how real racing cars move. The
        game requires players to slow down before bends in the track, and
        requires some foresight and planning for successful play. The game is
        popular as an educational tool teaching vectors.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In this implementation, autonomous cars race around a grid defined by
        a track drawn on a canvas. The cars are controlled by a function that
        uses information about the track to accelerate in either the x or y
        direction (or both) at each turn.
    </p>

        Below are some demonstrations of racetracks with some sample racer
        implementations.  The code for this simulator can be found on <a
        href="https://github.com/mckoss/racetrack">GitHub</a>.

        You can create your own racer directly on <a
